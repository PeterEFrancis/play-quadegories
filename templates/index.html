                  <h4>To Play with a Group</h4>
                  <p>Construct teams
                  or play individually. One player can be designated as the
                  reader or the players can rotate serving as reader each round.
                  At the beginning of each round the reader gets a new set of
                  four clues, and reads each, one at a time. Between clues the
                  reader counts to 5 on their hand.</p>

                  <p>At any time during each round, players still in the game
                  may make ONE attempt at the correct answer. A player
                  receives the number of points corresponding to the clue
                  that is given directly before the correct guess. An
                  incorrect answer results in zero points and elimination
                  from the round. The round continues until one player either
                  guesses correctly (winning points) or is eliminated from that
                  round by providing an incorrect answer </p>
                  <p>To any guess there are only three possible responses the
                  reader can give: CORRECT, INCORRECT or BE MORE SPECIFIC.
                  In the latter event, the player will be provided a
                  (one time only) additional five seconds to improve the
                  accuracy of the answer and either win the Quadegory or be
                  eliminated from that round.</p>
                  <p>
                  The game can end after a designated time or point total has
                  been reached.</p>

                  <h4>To Play Alone</h4>
                  <p>Read the clues and
                  whenever you are ready to guess, take a peak at the Quadegory!</p>

                  <h4>To Play Scoreless</h4> 
                  <p>Have fun reading
                  the clues and pay no mind to the time between each or who
                  answers first--just have fun!

                    Quadegories exercises the brain’s <i>executive function</i>
                    making it a valuable learning tool for teenagers and adults.

                    Executive function allows us to:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Make plans</li>
                      <li>Stay on task</li>
                      <li>Keep track of more than one thing at once</li>
                      <li>Reference past knowledge</li>
                      <li>Evaluate ideas</li>
                      <li>Change our minds</li>
                      <li>Finish work on time</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>Find yourself forgetful? Absent minded? Unable to make the
                    kinds of connections you’d easily make before?</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>You need Quadegories!</strong></p>
